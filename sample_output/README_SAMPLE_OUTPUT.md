## Transcription Analysis
### System Performance

```
├──Processing Time: 16 seconds
├──Input Duration: 1:54 (114 seconds)
├──VAD Filtering:  Removed 36.432 seconds of non-speech audio
├──Memory Usage:   Peak at processing initialization
├──GPU Usage:      Active during transcription phase
```

### Detected Audio Gaps
1. Opening Gap: 0.00 -> 10.70 seconds
   - Expected: Initial silence before speech
   - No content loss verified

2. Middle Gap: 68.80 -> 74.06 seconds
   - Natural pause in speech
   - Corresponds to document transition

### Quality Metrics
- Speech Recognition Accuracy: High
- Timestamp Precision: ±0.2 seconds
- Hebrew Text Rendering: Complete with proper RTL support
- Structural Enhancement: Successful formatting and organization

## About This Example

Israel's Declaration of Independence fits perfectly as the demonstration case, thanks to it's perfect balance of challenge and accessibility. Despite being a short recording of less than two minutes, it beautifully showcases the system's capabilities - successfully transcribing a historic recording with notably poor audio quality, while being just the right length for quick verification. There's also something poetic about using Israel's Declaration of Independence to demonstrate a Hebrew transcription model, especially when you see how the system transforms a challenging, aged recording into a perfectly structured document.
